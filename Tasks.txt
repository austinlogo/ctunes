* less

RESPONSIVENESS	
Supported envs

FEATURE BACKLOG (no specific order)

THINGS I'VE LEARNED THAT I SHOULD KEEP IN MIND
* res.download(file);
* res.json();
* xmlHttpRequest
	xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
	xmlHttp.open( "POST", "/upvote", false );
    xmlHttp.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"); 
    xmlHttp.send("id=" + trackId);
    var response = xmlHttp.responseText;


BUGS
* Stream ended unexpectedly
* EISDIROPEN error when adding tracks, we should handle that somehow
* not picking a file when uploading a file is a crash
	* I'm not sure what's causing it. Just look out and see what's going on.
* Duplicate entry handling

* enable ranged requests
